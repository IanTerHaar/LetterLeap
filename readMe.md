# LetterLeap

- LetterLeap (thank you chatGPT for the most cringe name ever) is a word puzzle game inspired by the 
popular "Wordle" game ('merica please don't sue).
- This project was attempted to see if I can actually create something functioning and 
pretty without my protential job taker, ChatGPT.
